For our visualization, we chose an IMDb movie dataset and chose to use the visualization to display quantitative visuals through bubble charts. We chose bubble charts because they are suitable for displaying hierarchical data and allow for easy comparison of values between different categories.

For the bubble chart, we encoded genres as bubbles with varying sizes based on the number of movies in each genre, providing an immediate visual comparison of genre popularity. We used color encoding to distinguish between different genres, aiding in quick identification. Interaction techniques such as clicking on a genre bubble trigger the display of a corresponding bubble chart for movies of that genre, facilitating exploration and comparison within a specific category.

For the movie bubble chart, we represented each movie as a bubble, with bubble size indicating its worldwide sales. We opted for this encoding to highlight the commercial success of movies and allow for comparison based on sales performance. Additionally, we displayed movie titles as labels within the bubbles for easy identification.

Development Process Overview:

The development process took about 25 hours to develop between the three of us. The data preprocessing was done via Zoom between the three of us including finding our dataset, cleaning up the data, and deciding what we were going to choose for the visualization. The majority of the time was spent on D3.js implementation, bubble chart research, and fine-tuning the visualizations.

Tasks were mostly done via Zoom,. Regular communication and feedback sessions ensured that the project progressed smoothly and met our design objectives.

Challenges arose during the implementation phase, particularly in handling the interaction between genre and movie bubble charts. Iterative testing and debugging were crucial in resolving issues and refining the user experience.

Overall, the development process was collaborative and iterative, with a focus on delivering an intuitive and visually appealing data visualization application. The team's combined effort and attention to detail resulted in a successful implementation that effectively communicates insights from the dataset to users.
